# Accessibility Features in SAP Job Scheduling Service

To optimize your experience of SAP Job Scheduling service, SAP Business Technology Platform \(SAP BTP\) provides features and settings that help you use the software efficiently.



> ### Note:  
> The SAP Job Scheduling service runs on the SAP BTP cockpit. For this reason, accessibility features for the SAP BTP cockpit also apply.
